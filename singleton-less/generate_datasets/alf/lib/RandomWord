'This paper reviews performance of hybrid and monolithically integrated \
transmitter arrays based on directly modulated lasers with a \
focus on the wavelength accuracy and stability under normal operating \
conditions We also consider power stability chromatic dispersion penalties \
and the channel cross talk Large numbers of four wavelength devices were \
obtained and evaluated under a program designed to provide university \
based system researchers with advanced components We show that multi \
wavelength laser arrays capable of high performance out of the box \
operation can be now produced for research type systems Future higher \
performance systems will be more complex than today s systems since the \
wavelength domain will be used to help route signals through different \
static or reconfigurable network paths In these next generation systems \
several parameters may vary which would have deleterious effects in a \
environment including variable insertion losses channel addition and \
deletion add drop multiplexing unstable laser power non uniform \
gain fast gain transients in cascades and non uniform accumulation \
of dispersion and nonlinearities In order to ensure robust system operation \
we discuss in this paper various dynamic schemes for compensating damaging \
effects so that these complex systems maintain high performance Additionally \
optical networks will provide high speed point to point connections and \
passive wavelength routing but the true power of optics for high throughput \
networking will require advances in high speed optical switching Significant \
functions and capabilities can be enabled by high speed optical switches \
and cross connects but issues regarding control and routing are ripe for \
extensive research We highlight one function that being all optical packet \
header replacement Peculiarities of dynamic phase hologram recording in \
photorefractive media having high optical non linearity are discussed \
Shifting and deformation of Bragg angle during recording of phase holograms \
was observed These effects were explained by titling and curving of the \
dynamic hologram during their recording and by variation of the photoinduced \
refractive index versus the hologram depth Computer generated holograms are \
limited by conventional lithographic fabrication capabilities which rely on \
accurate deposition exposure and developing of photosensitive chemicals \
We present alternate fabrication technologies which use a focused laser \
beam to write submicron patterns by inducing changes in a metal or silicon \
film and glass Circular laser writing systems built at are \
described This paper has reviewed some techniques and equipment for the \
fabrication of binary multilevel and continuous relief developed at \
The methods are discussed of the parallel optoelectronic realization \
of the compositional fuzzy inference rule and the multiple valued logic \
data processing scheme Original optoelectronic design gates are proposed \
for MAXIMUM MINIMUM LITERAL logic operators as well as for parametrical \
T operators Optoelectronic fuzzy controller set up is being realized on \
the basis of these logical gates The optical system for high speed data \
recording in the volume media is considered The increase of speed and \
density recording by more than one order is reached through the usage of \
The radial deflection of the light beam on the basis of the scanner with \
the accompaniment of a traveling acousto optical lens Multilayer recording \
of microgratings and multilevel phase data coding The heterodyne phase \
sensitive method of reading The evaluation of speed and bit density is \
given Adiabatically perturbed picosecond solitons are considered as the \
lock on signal carriers being distributed through an optical fiber sync \
network Interferometric technique of measuring time intervals with the \
help of train average field strength correlation functions to a \
subpicosecond accuracy is developed in the event of arriving the optical \
soliton like pulses at a high repetition rate Such an advantage of this \
technique as the ability of operating on the trains of low power picosecond \
optical pulses in particular adiabatically perturbed picosecond solitons \
in single mode fibers is revealed Results of trial experiments with the \
mock up implemented as optical part of the sync network for a short base \
radiointerferometer are present ':
