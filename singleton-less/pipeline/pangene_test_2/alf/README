Thank you for downloading ALF V1.0. This distribution consists of the following
files and directories

install.sh install script (instructions below)

bin/       - binaries of the darwin engine for Mac OS X and Linux
	   - starter scripts for darwin and ALF

lib/       - the darwin library
	   - the entire ALF source code is located in lib/simulator

params/    - sample parameter sets to reproduce some of the results from the
publication



INSTALLATION To run ALF it is not required to install the software, but we
think it will be more convenient.

To install ALF for your system, run the script install.sh. By default, this
will install the binary and script files in /usr/local/bin and the lib
directory in /usr/local/share/alfdarwin (this will require super user
privileges). If you wish to install in a different location, pass the location
to install.sh. For example, if you want to install ALF in your home directory,
use "./install.sh /home/your_username". This will create the directories
/home/your_username/bin and /home/your_username/share/alfdarwin if they don't
exist already.

RUNNING SIMULATIONS If you did not install ALF, run it with the following
command: bin/alfsim [path to parameter file]

If you did install ALF and the script is on your PATH, then this reduces to
alfsim [path to parameter file]

When no paramater file is given, ALF will look for the file parameters.drw in
the current working directory.

The example parameter file parameters.drw contains an explanation of all
available parameters. An easy way to create parameter files is the usage of the
ALF web service at http://www.alfsim.org This is also the place to get
the most recent version of ALF
